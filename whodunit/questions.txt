1.  What is <stdint.h>
        The stdint.h library allows programmers to access typedef macros to specify the width of the integer datatype aside from the default value to be
        allocated in memory. They are called Standard Integers
2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
        These ensures that the bits allocated for the Bitmap Win95 Standard are conforming to the standard, depending on the offset needed to place the bits
3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
        a BYTE has 1 byte
        a DWORD has 4 bytes
        a LONG has 4 bytes
        a WORD has 2 bytes
4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats
    (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
        ASCII -         BM
        Decimal -       66 77
        Hexadecimal -   0x42 0x4D
5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
        bfSize refers to the size of the bmp file in bytes while biSize refers to the size of BITMAPINFOHEADER struct
6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
        the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
        biBitCount
8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
        When the computer cannot access the file or not enough heap memory to allocate the file. It returns a NULL Pointer
9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
        We only have 1 bitmap to read
10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
        3
11. What does fseek do?
        Sets the current position or byte or address, whatever, in memory on where we would want to manipulate our bytes
12. What is SEEK_CUR?
        Denotes the current position of the file pointer

whodunit?
        It was colonel mustard with the candlestick in the library
